My name is James Hewitt, and I'm the IBM Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM) for the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. I focus on making the Cloud Pak for Integration and its underlying capabilities secure, servicable, and most importantly, cloud-native.

I love working with Open Source, I'm a certified IBM Cloud Solution Architect, and an IBM Master Inventor.

This blog is a place for me to write stuff down that I'm currently working on, whatever that might be.
